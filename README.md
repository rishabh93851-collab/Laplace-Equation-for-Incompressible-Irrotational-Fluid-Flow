# Laplace-Equation-for-Incompressible-Irrotational-Fluid-Flow
In fluid mechanics, the study of flow is essential for understanding the behavior of fluids in various applications, such as pipelines, airflow over wings, and groundwater flow. One of the fundamental equations governing the behavior of an incompressible and irrotational fluid flow is Laplace's equation.
